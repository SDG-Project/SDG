        <p class="intro">AFFORDABLE AND CLEAN ENERGY(SDG-7)</p>
        <p>Between 2000 and 2018, the number of people with electricity increased from 78 to 90 percent, and the numbers without electricity dipped to 789 million.</p>
        <p>Yet as the population continues to grow, so will the demand for cheap energy, and an economy reliant on fossil fuels is creating drastic changes to our climate.</p>
        <p>Investing in solar, wind and thermal power, improving energy productivity, and ensuring energy for all is vital if we are to achieve SDG 7 by 2030.</p>
        <p>Expanding infrastructure and upgrading technology to provide clean and more efficient energy in all countries will encourage growth and help the environment.  </p>
        <p class="intro">Goal targets</p>
        <ul>
            <li>By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services</li>
            <li>By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix</li>
            <li>By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency</li>
            <li>By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology</li>
            <li>By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing country</li>
        </ul>
